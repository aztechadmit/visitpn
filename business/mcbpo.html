			<p>In addition to presenting useful information to visitors, this website is also designed to generate profit in the form of advertising of local PN businesses - see methods section for more information.</p>
			<h2>Scope</h2>
			The scope of this MCBPO covers this website (Puertas Nuevas Visitor Information Portal) <b>only</b> and does not apply to any other operations within the Ministry of Recreation nor the Department of Tourism & Hopsitality.
			<h3>Scope of Operation</h3>
			This website is designed for visitors and guests not local to Puertas Nuevas. This includes those who have and have not been to the province before. Visitors and guests includes those visiting for commercial, business, and personal purposes.
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			In order to present information to visitors, this website is structured such that guests can easily find what they may be looking for, whether that be locations for corperate events, hotspots to visit on a vacation, or hotels and accomodations. This website also prevents an extensive list of attractions, activities, hotels, restaurants, and more which may be attractive to visitors.
