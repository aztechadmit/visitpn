        attractionSummary[2] = "Over five decades ago, DeBasc Miners Co. embarked on an ambitious mission to extract vast quantities of materials and resources to help construct some of Minecraftia's oldest and most iconic cities. Now, 50 years later, the Eastlands Quarry stands as a breathtaking testament to this effort, with enormous pits plunging hundreds of blocks deep into the earth. The discovery of a rich redstone deposit beneath the surface led to the development of a small but impactful Redstone Mining project, complementing the ongoing extraction of valuable resources.";
        attractionDescription[2] = "<h4>Minecraftia is Built on Eastlands</h4>Before the founding of Puertas Nuevas, the area now known as Eastlands was far from uninhabited. Hundreds of villages dotted the diverse terrain, home to miners who spent their days digging enormous pits into the lush landscape. The resources and materials gathered here were distributed across Minecraftia, forming the foundation of the vibrant cities that stand today. As mining activities altered the land, creating vast pits and rendering much of the area uninhabitable, it was named Eastlands. The bustling city of Puertas Nuevas was later established 30 chunks to the west.\
                                        <h4>Nature Finds Away</h4>Today, the Eastlands Quarry has been stripped of its valuable resources and has been reclaimed by nature. The hard stone bottom of the quarry collects water during rainfall, creating a unique aquatic ecosystem. This once barren pit now thrives with diverse wildlife and lush vegetation, a testament to nature's resilience and ability to adapt.";
        attractionHighlight[2] = "<h2>Know Before You Go</h2>Eastlands Quarry can only be reached by car, there is a small parking lot available. The drive to the quarry is long and features a windy road through the desert. Please plan accordingly.<p>Because the quarry is in the desert, it is HOT and there is a high-level of sun exposure. Bring sunscreen and plenty of water. Cell signal may be weak or unavailable at the quarry, and there is no signal at the bottom of the quarry.</p><p><b>Additional Considerations:</b>Although the quarry pit is filled with water, swimming, fishing, and other interaction with the water is NOT permitted. The water is highly contaminated with mineral deposits and is unsafe for human contact.</p>";
